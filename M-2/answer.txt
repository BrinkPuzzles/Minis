NaN, "Not a number."

It is a float. Is NaN "not lower," "not higher," and "not equal" to any number? You type x = float("NaN") and run the code.

yes!

But what does it mean?

You are invited onto the case and start poring over old evidence. Months later, you haven't cracked it but at least no one is searching the docks, or pirate-themed rides at the amusement park.

One night you're going through the evidence locker and you catch sight of a safe tagged with the case number. It was opened long ago by serving a warrant to the manufacturer. It turned out to be empty. "We still have this thing?"

You walk over. It has a digital readout and a keypad. "Not a number..." The only key that's not a number is "E" for enter. You push it four times.

Something scrolls across the screen:

515 Medford St

It's only a few blocks away. You run downstairs.
